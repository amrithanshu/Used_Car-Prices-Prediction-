# Used_Car-Prices-Prediction-
🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

This project predicts used car prices based on historical datasets. It follows a structured Data Science & Machine Learning lifecycle that connects business understanding with technical implementation.

📌 Business Problem

Buying and selling used cars is a complex process influenced by multiple factors such as brand, model, mileage, year, fuel type, and more. An accurate price prediction model helps:

Customers evaluate fair prices

Dealers optimize pricing strategies

Platforms increase trust in listings

🔑 Project Phases
**Phase 1: Domain Understanding
**
Define Problem Statement: Predict used car prices.

Understand business impact: Increase transparency in the used car market.

Identify domain terms & formulas: e.g., depreciation, mileage adjustment.

Draft project architecture & workflow.

**Phase 2: Data Collection & Analysis
**
Gather dataset (car listings with price and features).

Explore features: brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Define business & technical requirements.

**Phase 3: Database & Reporting
**
Store raw and processed data in a structured database.

Clean and transform data based on requirements.

Create relationship graphs between features.

Generate reports, dashboards, and summaries for insights.

**Phase 4: Model Building & Evaluation
**
Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).

Select features and target (Price).

Split data into train, validation, test sets.

Apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Evaluate models (RMSE, R², MAE).

Tune hyperparameters and select best model.

Make predictions on unseen data.

**Phase 5: Deployment
**
Deploy best model with Flask / FastAPI backend.

Build simple user interface (UI) for predictions.

Enable users to input car details and get price predictions.
