    "## Formuloes to Focus for the price\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Depreciation Formula\n",
    "Depreciation is one of the key factors in determining the price of a used car. A common approach is to use a depreciation rate to estimate the current value based on the original price.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depreciated Value = Original Price×(1−Depreciation Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age Depreciated Value=Original Price×(1−Depreciation Rate) Age\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Original Price: The initial purchase price of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depreciation Rate: The annual depreciation rate (commonly between 15-25% for most cars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Age: The number of years the car has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mileage Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher mileage usually reduces the car’s value. The adjustment can be calculated based on the average annual mileage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mileage Adjustment = ( Actual Mileage − Average Mileage ) × Mileage Depreciation Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mileage Adjustment=(Actual Mileage−Average Mileage)×Mileage Depreciation Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual Mileage: The current odometer reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Mileage: The expected mileage for the car’s age (e.g., 12,000-15,000 miles per year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mileage Depreciation Rate: The depreciation value per mile (varies by car make/model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Condition Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the value based on the car's condition (excellent, good, fair, poor).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition Adjustment = Base Value × Condition Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Adjustment=Base Value×Condition Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Value: The value after considering depreciation and mileage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Factor: A multiplier based on condition (e.g., 1.1 for excellent, 0.9 for fair).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Market Demand and Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust based on current market demand and supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market Adjustment = Base Value × Market Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Adjustment=Base Value×Market Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Factor: A factor based on the current market trend for the specific make/model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "A combined formula considering all factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimated Price = ( Original Price × ( 1 − Depreciation Rate ) Age ) + ( Actual Mileage − Average Mileage ) × Mileage Depreciation Rate × Condition Factor × Market Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated Price=(Original Price×(1−Depreciation Rate) Age )+(Actual Mileage−Average Mileage)×Mileage Depreciation Rate×Condition Factor×Market Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a car had an original price of $20,000, is 5 years old, with 60,000 miles (average annual mileage is 12,000 miles), in good condition, with a market factor of 1.05, and depreciation rates as follows:\n",

    " \n",
    "Mileage Depreciation Rate: $0.10 per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Factor: 0.95 for good condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depreciation Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "Depreciated Value = 20000 × ( 1 − 0.2 ) 5\n",
    "\n",
    "= 20000 × 0.32768 = 6553.60\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "=20000×0.32768\n",
    "\n",
    "=6553.60\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mileage Adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mileage Adjustment = ( 60000 − 60000 ) × 0.10 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Mileage Adjustment=(60000−60000)×0.10=0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition Adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Adjustment = 6553.60 × 0.95 = 6225.92\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Adjustment=6553.60×0.95=6225.92\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Market Adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Adjustment = 6225.92 × 1.05 = 6537.21\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Adjustment=6225.92×1.05=6537.21\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the estimated price of the car would be approximately $6537.21."
